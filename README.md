# Neural Network for Doubling Numbers

> Preparation for the internship of CNP Vita Assicura

## Description

This is a simple neuronal network that uses the Keras library and Tensorflow.
Keras is used to create the network and Tensorflow is used to train it.

The network is trained to give you the double of a number. 
It is trained with 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in input and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 in output. It is trained with 1000 epochs. After that, you can test the network with any number you want by typing it in the console.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-doubling.git
   cd neural-network-doubling
   ```
2. Install the required packages: `pip install tensorflow keras`
3. Run the script `python3 main.py`
4. Type a number in the console to test the network after the training completes.

## Example

This example demonstrates the neural network's ability to accurately predict the double of a given number after training.
